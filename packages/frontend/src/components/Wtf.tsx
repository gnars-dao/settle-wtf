          Gnars is a community owned (and run) extreme sports club. We prefer a
          world where kids aren’t shilled energy drinks by their heroes. So as a
          community of action sports enthusiasts, we’ve formed a DAO to rethink
          how shredders get sponsored. Based on Nouns open source code and CC0
          artwork, they’re stored fully on-chain on Ethereum with no external
          dependencies (not even IPFS), and each one represents a DAO vote.
          We’re changing the way extreme sport is funded with backing from Nouns
          DAO. Start creating Gnars off-chain using the Playground or learn more
          at gnars.com.

          Ethereum Blocks last 12 seconds, so you need to act FAST. When a Gnar
          appears that you want to mint, you must click “Settle auction” and
          confirm in your wallet. Both of these steps must occur during the
          current block. Otherwise, your transaction will fail.

          Congratulations! But you’re not done yet! Your Gnar is now up for
          auction on the Gnars website. Place your bid and good luck!
